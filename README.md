# react-graphql-workshop
This is a training project for the MyHeritage React+GraphQL workshop


## Setup
1. Install git
2. `git clone https://github.com/ShaniRaby/react-graphql-workshop.git`
3. `cd react-graphql-workshop`
4. `npm install`
5. To make sure everything is set up correctly type:
   <br/>`cd exercises/1-react/`
   <br/>`npm start`
   <br/>We created the React apps using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and `npm start` should run the app. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## IDE
Make sure you have an IDE installed on your computer: Visual Studio Code, Atom, IntelliJ — whatever you prefer.
(If you're a VIM user — more power to you!)

## What's in This Repository?
This repository is comprised of two directories:

**`exercises`**: A directory with "skeletons" and TODOs for the two exercises we'll work on in this workshop: one for React and the second for GraphQL. Instructions for the exercises can be found in each directory.

**`solutions`**: For the same exercise. Can be used as reference during the workshop (though if you're stuck you'll have someone to ask for guidance!) or later at home.
