## What's In This Repository?
This repository is compiled of two parts:
**Excersises**: A directory with "sekeletons" and TODOs for the two excersised we'll work on in this workshop: one for React and the second for GraphQL. Instructions for the exercises can be found in each directory.
**Solutions**: For the same exercise. Can be used as reference during the workshop (though if you're stuck you'll have someone to ask for guidence!) or later at home.
