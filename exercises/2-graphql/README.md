# GraphQL Exercise
Here you'll find the same React app from the previous exercise, only this time you'll be using GraphQL to fetch the needed data.

## Preparation
 1. Create a file named `tokens.js` under `/Applications/FamilyAlbum/Constants/`
 2. type `export const FAMILY_GRAPH_QL_TOKEN = 'YOUR_FGQL_TOKEN';`
 3. Go to http://www.familygraphql.com/fiddle 
 4. Open the console
 5. Type `oauthToken`
 6. Copy the token and paste it instead of `YOUR_FGQL_TOKEN`.
 
## What you need to do
 - Using the [fiddle](http://www.familygraphql.com/fiddle) create your query, and then use it in `/src/index.js` to make your request.
