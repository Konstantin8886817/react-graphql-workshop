# React Excersise
In this excersise you'll find a React app with data about the Simpsons family. The app contains Homer's photo.

## What you need to do
- Use the Photo component as an example, and create a new Card component to display detils about a family member: photo, name, and birth date. [Composit](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#composing-components) the Card component using the Photo component.
- Allow the user to choose Homer's favorite family member by clicking on the cards. You should save this family member in the [app's state](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-state.html). You can display this person's photo at the top of the page, near Homer's.
- Add size as prop to Photo component to make it more reusable in different situations (alternatively, you can [pass a className](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-styling.html) and control the size using CSS classes).
